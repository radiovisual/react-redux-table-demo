# react-redux-table-demo

> A React/Redux Table App Demo to fulfill all your hopes and dreams.

:boom: This app is a work in progress. It is mainly here for my own experiments in React/Redux.

Live Demo: [https://radiovisual.github.io/react-redux-table-demo/](https://radiovisual.github.io/react-redux-table-demo/)

## TODO

- [ ] Bug: sometimes must double-click to get column to sort
- [ ] Tests!
- [ ] Filter by username should be more robust
- [ ] Add support for persisted state
